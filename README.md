# HouseLemming

This is a Razor ASP.NET Core 2.1-based project to create a website for the advertisement of properties, primarily for the student rental market.
It does not have support for the creation of users with predefined roles but has prepopulated users of each available role for testing purposes since authorization and authentication functionalities are both present.
The website is fully responsive and cross-platform.

# Roles
## Admin
Is able to approve or deny requests for adverts to go live and view any and all adverts on the system of all states.

## Landlords
Can create adverts, edit them, view their state and request them to go live or take them offline.

## Users
Can view only the active and approved advertisments.

# Design
Throughout, great responsive and interactive design has been used so as to ensure that the system is easy to use and understand.
